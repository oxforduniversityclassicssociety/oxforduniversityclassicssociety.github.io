	<h2> Meet the commitee </h2>
	<p>
	<img src="commitee/marianne.jpeg", width=300> <br>
	Χαιρε! My name is Marianne (she/her) and I am very proud to be your president (/dictator) for this year. I am a third year studying Classics with Sanskrit, and find my passions captured primarily by the literature and grammar side of the ancient world (shout out to the genitive! My favourite case)
	<br>
	Favourite classical figure: Turnus, king of the Rutuli
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="commitee/oliver.jpeg", width=300> <br>
	Ave! I’m Oliver (he/him), a 3rd year classicist at BNC. I’m a lover of all things theatre and history, and I’m really looking forward to running the society as vice president this year!
	<br>
	Favourite classical figure: Diogenes of Sinope - anyone who can put Plato in his place is good in my books
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="commitee/charlotte.jpeg", width=300> <br>
	Salve, my name is Charlotte (she/her). I am a 2nd year classicist at LMH and official representative of the cult of Dionysus. I love all things Greek theatre and think that most, if not all, problems can be solved by shouting οι μοι at them.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="commitee/ted.jpeg", width=300> <br>
	My name is Ted (he/him) and I'm a third year at New College doing... not classics (shock horror). Despite spending my days doing maths and philosophy, I love a bit of the ancient world, especially in the context of those two subjects. I'm also a big fan of Greek theatre and having quasi-religious experiences in Pompeii.
	<br>
	Favourite classical figure: Archimedes and his giant boat-crushing claw
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="commitee/nat.jpeg", width=300> <br>
	Hi, I'm Nat (they/them), 3rd year CAMES-ist at bnc. I love all things folky and old, especially ancient languages and song!
	<br>
	Favourite classical figure: Medea or Dido
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="commitee/izzy.jpeg", width=300> <br>
	Hi I'm Izzy, a 1st year at LMH doing classics. Always happy to go down rabbit holes of obscure ancient history like the Minoans. Favourite classical figure: Homer (I know basic but I don't know who else to do).
	<br>
	Favourite fictional classic figure: Ariadne
